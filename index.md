# Intro

Pi boards (Raspberry, Orange, Banana and others) are small and powerful enough
to create something useful and interesting. For example, a home-made media center.

Sure, you can buy a ready-made solution: Smart TV, Media player, or just connect your Smartphone to the TV.

But engineer inside says:

*- Why not to create it on my own? Make it the way I want.
Give a second life to the devices I already have.*


Most of Pi boards have HDMI or AV outputs (via connectors, expansion boards or special pins).
TV sets have HDMI or AV inputs.
Let's connect them together, configure Linux and setup media software,
write some code and have fun.
