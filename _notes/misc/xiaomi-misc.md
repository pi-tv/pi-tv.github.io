# Portable hotspot turns off after 5 minutes problem

Mobile hotspot automatically turns off after some minutes, when a phone is locked. And laptop,
connected through this hotspot disconnects from the internet again and again?

This solved the problem for me and made the hotspot work:

```text
Settings -> 
    Battery & performance ->
        Gear in the top right corner ->
            Turn off mobile data when device is locked = Never
```
